Create a mesh network using 802.11s as link layer and bmx6 as layer 3 routing protocol

1. Execute the prepare.sh script by sending the comand: "sh /root/prepare.sh"
2. Node will configure itself and reboot
3. Once rebooted you can see the mesh nodes using the bmx6 command line tool:
 bmx6 -c links
 bmx6 -c originators
 bmx6 -cp
 bmx6 -cd8
4. Every 5 minutes the number of nodes seen in the network is saved in the /save directory
5. When the experiment is finished the /save results will be sent to the Wibed controller and available for analysis
